**Welcome to Jazz Chord Generator**

The idea is to create smooth jazz chords and voicings based upon user input.
A user is prompted to give a starting note and then decide what chord, extension or voicing to build.
This runs within the terminal but in the future, I plan to create a dynamic web page.
Read jazzKnowledge.md for the music theory.

Required packages:
- node.js
- prompt npm


Addition of a scale creator coming soon as well!
